Originally my ladybug endlessly consumed the little bug-thing and there was no real satisfying end-point of this game. I was noticing after letting my roommates play that they were quickly bored awaiting some kind of a purpose. Yes, yes well fine, guys, I will make it more interesting for you. I implemented a timer and a goal of bugs to consume within 30 seconds. Dan Shiffman's snake game was inexorably helpful and and enlivened my process in this assignment. Now that I think about it, it would have been fun to stick to a similar idea but make her grow fat and then explode after eating too many of the bugs, hehe.

Making pretty animated art sketches is fun, but this interactive programming takes it all to a much more exciting level. I can't even fathom how people program more complex games, but I truly appreciate their brains.

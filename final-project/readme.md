### Idea
My final project ended up being the second idea in my indecisive proposal: some kind of dreamy art piece implementing music + images. The idea was inspired by Dan Shiffman's video on creating object trails. I was pretty mesmerized with that, and thought to make the objects look like little wispy spirits keeping their movement on the canvas random to kind of symbolize sentient spirit thingys. I enjoy witchy aesthetics in art, so the concept wasn't too hard to come up with: hands and a floating sphere/ crystal ball where the wispy spirit objects are released. (afterthought: would have been neat to have the objects writhing about as they are constrained within the sphere, and then somehow literally released, but I am uncertain how I would have translated that idea into p5 language...)

### Images
I had a few hurdles to go through, but most specifically with the images. I had a hard time recognizing that it was Chrome's fault for the endless console error messages with the images, and once I installed the local server in atom, and downloaded firefox all was fine. I created the background in photoshop. While I was considering drawing the hands and sphere in p5, using photoshop made the design more smooth and succinct. I wanted to make the sphere in 3D WEBGL mode, but was worried that I would have too many issues and not enough time to grasp it. I was also worried about conflict between 2D and 3D on one canvas. I had read some things about making multiple canvas' but wasn't entirely sure how I'd make that work out. (By what I read in forumâ€™s I think what I wanted to do was possible, but I am not sure. Would it have worked if I used WEBGL for the central crystal ball sphere and kept all the other things 2D?)

### Sound
The sound was simple enough to implement once I saw the message in the CC_120 issues forum about the commented-out p5 sound in html (thanks by the way!)  I was feeling optimistic when I wrote the proposal and had imagined composing something new in ableton for this sketch, but I ended up using an old song of mine that was sufficiently eerie enough for this piece. The twinkly sound when you click the mouse I purchased off a sound archive online.

### Conclustions
I'm really pleased with my final piece. While I was considering turning this piece into a similar simple game I made in a previous assignment, (ie how many spirits can you free in 30 seconds, or something... ((I was also considering implementing a clock, which is what the commented-out central clock is in my code))) but I decided against it. I find it kind of soothing to have no purpose to this other than to hear the nice glittery bell sound when you click the mouse and 'release a spirit.'

I'm feeling pretty decent at the end of this semester. This class was extremely difficult, but it was also super rewarding. I still have a long ways to go, but think that I'll definitely be utilizing p5 as I go along within personal creative projects.

My final project ended up being the second idea in my indecisive proposal: some kind of dreamy art piece implementing music +  and images. The idea was inspired by Dan Shiffman's video on creating object trails. I was pretty mesmerized with that, and thought to make the object’s look like little wispy spirits keeping their movement on the canvas random to kind of symbolize sentient spirit thingys, their direction something of its own accord.  I created the background tediously in photoshop. While I was considering drawing the hands and sphere in p5, using photoshop made the design more smooth and succinct. I wanted to make the sphere in 3D WEBGL mode, but was worried that I would have too many issues and not enough time to grasp it. I was also worried about conflict between 2D and 3D on one canvas. I had read some things about making multiple canvas' but wasn't entirely sure how I'd make that work out. (I find that I still don't understand the language in forums when discussing and debugging certain issues in code... still too complex for me! By what I read I think what I wanted to do was possible? Would it have worked if I used WEBGL for the central crystal ball sphere?)

I had a few hurdles to go through, but most specifically with the images. I had a hard time recognizing that it was Chrome's fault for the endless console error messages with the images, and once I installed the local server in atom, and downloaded firefox all was fine.

The sound was simple enough to implement once I saw the message in the CC_120 issues forum about the commented-out p5 sound in html.  I was feeling optimistic when I wrote the proposal and had imagined composing something new in ableton for this sketch, but I ended up using an old song of mine that was sufficiently eerie enough for this piece. The twinkly sound when you click the mouse I purchased off a sound archive online.

I'm really pleased with my final piece. While I was considering turning this piece into a similar simple game I made in a previous assignment, (ie how many spirits can you free in 30 seconds, or something... ((I was also considering implementing a clock, which is what the commented-out central clock is in my code, I don’t want to lose it!))) but I decided against it. I find it kind of soothing to have no purpose to this other than to hear the nice glittery bell sound when you click the mouse and 'release a spirit.'

I'm feeling pretty decent at the end of this semester. This class was extremely difficult, but it was also super rewarding. I still have a long ways to go, but think that I'll definitely be utilizing p5 as I go along within personal creative projects.

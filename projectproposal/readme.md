# Kimberly Pierson Final Project Proposal

I need help picking between two ideas, but essentially they will both include the following elements:

I want to incorporate external images + sound and make an animated virtual art design. I had some issues incorporating external images in past sketches (though I am wondering if it was a chrome issue) so I will have to work through that + learn how to incorporate sound.

## Idea number 1:
Fact about me to understand the project idea: I pretty crazy about birds, and am doing an internship at [an exotic parrot sanctuary](https://thegabrielfoundation.org/) this summer to hang out with 600+ parrots and do some graphic design work for the sanctuary.

### The project:

 A lot of potential parrot adopters daydream about having birds because they are so beautiful, but don’t consider their 50+ year lifespan that includes incredibly loud screaming. A lot of people wonder what the screams of the different parrots sound like before they adopt them and ask if they can keep them in an apartment sucessfully ect. With all this in mind,  I was thinking of making a design with images or sketches of the more common adoptable parrots + bringing in sound clips of their vocals so that when you click on the graphic image of a specific parrot, you can hear their squawk. If this turned out to be too insane, I might just make some kind of bird visual with sounds, maybe have it be animated wings flapping about or something. Essentially idea 1 is something animated with birds!

## Idea number 2:
Another fact about me: [I dig making electronic music](https://soundcloud.com/kimberly-pierson), so I am also considering making some kind of neat surrealistic virtual animated and interactive design sketch with a composed piece of music over it.

The former project might help benefit this specific parrot sanctuary I’m volunteering at (or maybe not, maybe just for my own delight) and the latter project would be more for my own cathartic artistic final project implementing music.

I like both ideas. Maybe ultimately it will become a blend of the two?

So the way I managed to keep up with coding this semester was spend the early days in the week focusing in on coding. I’ll keep doing that with this final project, work Monday-Thursday on it. I only have two weeks so I’ll probably do late nights, too, and beg and plea with my javascript savvy roommate to stay up and help me work through + implement certain ideas. ( he’s been my savior this semester being a distance student and not being able to come to lab hours...)

No links other than the above links to the place I’m interning at, and my soundcloud. Everything is swirling around in my brain. Hope that is okay.

Either route, it’s gotta be aesthetically pretty so I’m working on the backdrop and stylistic elements at the moment. I’m pretty terrified, but I’m pretty excited. I'm pretty overwhemled, too, but that is probably my own fault making this proposal so long and being slightly torn between concepts.

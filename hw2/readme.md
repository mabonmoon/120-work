### Summarize the work for this homework cycle. Paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
This past homework cycle was an *intense* week of many new synapses forming in my brain. I stuck to following all recommendations provided by the instructor as both those recommended options and others were all equally unfamiliar territory to me.
 * Atom
 * GitHub Desktop
 * Git Bash

### What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
1. Followed closely the module for week 2 on the Creative Coding website.
2. Downloaded Atom
3. Downloaded Github Desktop
4. Linked GitHub Desktop to GitHub.com with my 120-work repository
5. The [Cheatsheet notes for markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) were definitely bookmarked and readily accessable!

### Did you have any problems or issues? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?

I did post an issue in the issues forum pertaining to the .gitattributes icon that I can see on my project drop-down menu within Atom and my repository on GitHub. I was comforted to discover other classmates also had it on their project menu, so I didn't do anything wrong (whew!) I found myself wanting to post various questions within the issues forum, but held back and continued through the week's module and found my answers before too much panic ensued. Slow and steady wins the race in this new world of coding.

I am having a little bit of trouble understanding the inline coding example. I tried to include some html text but that didn't seem to work out well.
```
git commit
```

### Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
I downloaded all of the recommended packages in the week 2 module for Atom, but I am a little overwhelmed at how many packages there are. It would be nice to go over the ones we downloaded in greater detail and learn of others.

### What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
This week I was heavily focused on setting up and beginning to familiarize myself with of all these new programs as I assume the rest of my classmates were doing. I feel like in the upcoming weeks there will be an abundance of opportunities to help other classmates (and seek help!) as we continue exploring this new universe together.

Woah, I made a drawing with code! That was amazing!

There were a lot of things that were painful this week, though. I think the most difficult for me was trying to figure out where to map the shapes on the correct x and y coordinates without some kind of a graph to give me a visual clue (I am terrible at math!) Thankfully,  I was able to insert the graph provided in the week's batch codes (nested in with those smiley face example codes.) I only kept the graph temporarily while I was working on my drawing, but without that graph I might have gone insane. Very grateful for that code, thanks!

For the first few days I had the idea to do a low poly self-portrait (a portrait made up of many polygons.) It ended up being with triangles though. Also it became a monster instead of myself. Through photoshop I covered a self-portrait photograph in numerous triangles, and then I would hover my mouse over each corner point of each triangle to transcribe the x and y coordinates,  and insert those coordinates into atom. This seemed like an extremely tedious process, though. I ended up simplifiying the idea greatly, and figured it all out for the most part. I do think I'll have to insert that graph into every sketch I do until my visualisation ( and my math ) becomes second nature, or something. (any tips?)I would have loved to take advantage of the in-person lab, but alas living in Bozeman!

I was very nervous about the translate, rotate, and scale functions and I really need more in-depth descriptions of how to utilize those (*please!*) My mind just couldn't wrap its head around manipulating the graph because I had spent all week trying to understand where the graph was in the first place. The function within atom for degrees to be converted into radians //radians()// was wonderfully helpful, though. I don't know if I could convert radians to degrees every time I wanted to make an arc, so I am very grateful for that handy trick!

Besides my lacking math skills, I had a blast this week. Even when I was tediously typing in the endless ellipse fuction for my monster's horn (which is there a shortcut for things like that? I have about a hundred lines of ellipses to make it look more 3D, it took forever but worth it!) I was having fun. I don't want this class to end! Thanks guys!

##week 6



I need a month on week 6 alone to grasp it. This week I began to understand week 5 better, so maybe I am just a week or two behind in learning ... It feels like this course is moving so fast ...

 I really wanted the sun rays to slowly bloom around the sun, but could not figure out how to make that work! I was imagining the smoke plumes coming out from the back of it, too, but I do not have the skill set yet for such ideas. I don't know that my sketch included an algorithm, unless the orbs created by the mouseX and mouseY counts as an evolving art, but I made so many things randomized. My sketch changes over time with interaction from the mouse, but doesn't create *itself* overtime, it just animates. Again I mostly just familiarized myself more with week 5 in this sketch. I wish I felt this way when I was creating my week 5 animation. Ugh.

Dejected again this week, not because the possibilites are so astoundingly beautiful within this class, but because my brain is having a hard time keeping up. It feels like things slip away right after I grasp them. A moment of enlightenment on how something works and then poof, it's gone. My readme is sounding like a diary entry.

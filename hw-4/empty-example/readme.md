Woah, I made a drawing with code! That was amazing!

There were a lot of things that were painful this week, though. I think the most difficult for me was trying to figure out where to map the shapes on the correct x and y coordinates without some kind of a graph to give me a visual clue (I am terrible at math!) Thankfully,  I was able to insert the graph provided in the week's batch codes (nested in with those smiley face example codes.) I only kept the graph temporarily while I was working on  my drawing, but without that graph I might have gone insane.

For the first few days I had the idea to do a low poly self-portrait (a portrait made up of many polygons.) It ended up being with triangles though. Also it became a monster instead of myself. Anyways, my method was that I covered my self-portrait in photoshop in triangles and I would hover my mouse over certain points to transcribe those x and y coordinates to re-create the same shapes in atom. This seemed like an extremely tedious process, though. I tried to send an email for guidance, but didn't get a response :( That's okay! I simplified the idea greatly, and figured it all out for the most part. I do think I'll have to insert that graph into every sketch I do until my visualisation ( and my math ) becomes second nature, or something. I would have loved to take advantage of the in-person lab, but alas living in Bozeman.

I was very nervous about the translate, rotate, and scale functions and I really need more in-depth descriptions of how to utilize those (*please!*)
My mind just couldn't wrap its head around manipulating the graph because I had spent all week trying to understand where the graph was in the first place. The function for radians that exists was wonderfully helpful, though.

Besides my lacking math skills, I had a blast this week. Even when I was tediously typing in the endless ellipses for my monster's horn (which PLEASE inform me of the shortcut for things like that ...) I was having fun. I don't want this class to end! Thanks guys!

Feeling a little dejected this week as I am really struggling with the math concepts for the loops. I know it's supposed to be ‘simple’ math but I am just taking a bit longer in that regard.
On the bright side I spent the majority of the week trying to clean up last week's hw-4 assignment with a loop for the ellipses that made the horn on my monster more clean.

I have a friend here in Bozeman good with Java Script who was able walk me through the math and creating a successful more simplified code for the horns, but I struggled with transferring the concept to a new design and should have stuck to animating the monster. We were working with the ’while’ loop, and I think with what I was trying to do in this animation I should have been working with the ‘if’ loop.

I was really excited at making a shape move across a screen this week though. Baby steps. Watching one of Dan Shiffman’s videos I learned about the mousePressed function, which was kind of fun when implementing the mouseX + mouseY cursor doodles to be  able to ‘start over’ with a blank canvas, but what I really wanted was my tiny white ellipses to fall and twinkle forever and I couldn’t figure that out yet. Awaiting eagerly more 'aha!' moments in this coding language. 

What a week.

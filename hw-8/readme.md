# [Live Sketch Link](https://mabonmoon.github.io/120-work/hw-8/)

I needed this week, thank you. It was slower paced and allowed me to play and better familiarize myself with the for and while loops without wanting to pull my hair out. I had attempted to implement those loops in past sketches (some successful, some definitely not successful). I can still feel the stress from week 6's algorithm sketch...  This week definitely helped ease my mental sufferings and feel a little more caught up.

I didn't necessarily mean to make a spooky deity-esque floating head wind lady, my original goal was just to create some kind of a storm, but I like her hanging out there. I didn't even have to insert the graph this time to wrap my head around the coordinates! It just took lots of tedious tweaking and shifting to get things how I liked it.

I haven't gotten to participate much in helping other classmates, so I am a little worried about lacking points in that arena. I'll try and focus in more on that kind of stuff. (though it is hard to feel like everyone is not light-years ahead of me in this class, but I think it is just the distance-learning stuff makes this class feel very solitary. I have no idea, maybe people are as terrible with the math elements as I am!?)

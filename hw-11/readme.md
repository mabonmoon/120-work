## [Live Sketch](https://mabonmoon.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)

I know, I am sorry for what your eyes just had to witness... it disturbs me, too. I do believe this is what having a creatively off-week looks like. I think the most painful part of this was simply placing the eyeballs on my mousePressed() alien face... simple math continuing to elude me.  I don't mean to write a shorter readme this week, I'm just mentally collapsed at this point.


See you next week with hopefully a more aesthetically pleasing sketch from my end...

## [Live Sketch](https://mabonmoon.github.io/120-work/hw-10/)

I had some issues with trying to put an image into my sketch with the
function preload() and loadImage. When I would open my index.html in chrome it would say 'Loading...'' I tried rearranging its positioning, making sure my code was correct and finally it stopped saying loading, but would just turn my canvas completely black! While the code wasn't completely broken because at least I was getting the background color, it was maddening, so I gave up. Initially my idea was to put this image ![Image](images/hand.png) into the mousePressed function so that it would appear everytime mouse was pressed along with the new planet object bing created. Oh well, I still think the result of this sketch is kind of nice. The slow evolution of the central planet's overlapping from slight movement pleases my eyes. I'm a pretty big fan of the color randomizing, and randomizing the height and width of lines, but keeping their x and y coordinates stationary so they create this nice lovely expansive quality.
